# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project
## Executive Summary
In this capstone project, my main adjective was to predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9,  will land successfully using machine learning techniques and past data.
The steps were as follows:
- Data collection, data wrangling, data formatting
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization
- Machine learning prediction
We concluded that using a decision tree model would be the most accurate prediction model based on our training and test set.
