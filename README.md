# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project
## Executive Summary
In this capstone project, my main adjective was to predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9,  will land successfully using machine learning techniques and past data.
The steps were as follows:
- Data collection, data wrangling, data formatting
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization
- Machine learning prediction

We concluded that using a decision tree model would be the most accurate prediction model based on our training and test set.

## Introduction
In this capstone project, we will be predicting if the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. The Falcon 9 project is revolutionary because its cost is substantially cheaper than it would be for other competitor rockets. It costs 62 million to produce while others cost around 150 million. The reason it can save so much money is because of its ability to reuse the first stage.
What we are trying to answer is, for a set of features on the Falcon 9 rocket such as payload mass, orbit type, launch type, etc… will the rocket land successfully?

## Methodology
The overall methodology is as follows:
1) Data collection, wrangling, and formatting
- SpaceX API
- Web scraping
2) Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SQL
3) Data visualization
- Maplotlib
- Seaborn
- Folium
- Dash
4) Machine learning prediction
- Logistic regression
- Support vector machines (SVM)
- Decision tree
- K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
